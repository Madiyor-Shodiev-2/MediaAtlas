# MediaAtlas Docker Configuration Fixes

## Summary of Implemented Fixes

### 1. Docker Configuration
- Updated Dockerfile to handle permissions correctly
- Removed premature composer commands from Dockerfile
- Added proper volume mounts in docker-compose.yml
- Added health checks and restart policies
- Set up correct container names for consistency

### 2. Database Connection
- Corrected DB_HOST to "media-atlas-db" in .env
- Updated DB_PORT to use the correct container port (5432)
- Successfully ran database migrations to set up required tables

### 3. Permission Issues
- Set proper ownership with www-data user
- Added correct file permissions (775)
- Mounted volumes with proper permissions using delegated mode
- Added separate mounts for critical directories (storage, cache)

## Current Status
The application is now running properly and accessible at http://localhost:99. You can now:
1. Access the login page
2. Register new users
3. Use the application normally

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check Application Logs
```bash
docker exec media-atlas-app tail -f /var/www/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### Check Container Status
```bash
docker compose ps
```

### Restart Services if Needed
```bash
docker compose restart
```

### Rebuild Containers After Code Changes
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

## Configuration Files Updated
- docker-compose.yml
- docker/Dockerfile
- .env

## Notes for Future Development
- When deploying to production, consider updating the APP_ENV and APP_DEBUG settings
- For database backups, consider adding a volume for PostgreSQL dumps
- Consider implementing Docker health checks for all services in production
